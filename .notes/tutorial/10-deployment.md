# Step 10: Deployment

**Learn:** Build optimization, Nginx, production deployment

## Concepts
- **Build optimization**: Minify and bundle for production
- **Nginx**: Web server for static file hosting
- **Production deployment**: Deploy to Raspberry Pi

## Actions
- [ ] Configure Vite for production build in `vite.config.ts`
- [ ] Add build scripts to `package.json` (build, preview, check, lint, format)
- [ ] Create production build: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test production build locally: `npm run preview`
- [ ] Create deployment script for Raspberry Pi
- [ ] Configure Nginx on Raspberry Pi for static file serving
- [ ] Deploy and test from external device

## Verify
- [ ] Game loads and runs on Raspberry Pi from external device
